sensord
---

BoatSensord is an extensible daemon for integrating different sensors on a boat to a Signal K network. It supports a plugin architecture which allows creation of plugins to support additional sensors.

It currently supports a BME280 sensor that provides temperature, humidity and pressure readings from a Raspberry Pi.

For instructions on setting up a BME280 sensor on a Raspberry Pi, see [Mobile App Controlled Weather Station for Raspberry Pi](https://www.partmarine.com/blog/nine_dollar_weather_station_for_raspberry_pi/) tutorial.
